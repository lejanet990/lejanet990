    <h1> MY EXPERIENCE </h1> 
    <p> Hi there, I'm Janet! I'm passionate about food insecurity because my father's family often didn't have enough to eat and his stories both moved me and inspired me. I joined my high school's student council class freshman year, and we did projects such as the districtwide food drive for Outback, our district food pantry. It was then that I realized the extent of food insecurity. Seeing boxes and bags of canned beans and ramen, I was also concerned about the nutrition quality of donated items. I wanted to help people get access not just to food, but fresh vegetables and fruits. </p>
    <p> I began volunteering in earnest at our regional food bank my sophmore year when I was able to drive. I learned about the different colored builds (blue, red, USDA, meat, Tyson, etc) for mobile pantry boxes during my shifts at the Distribution Warehouse. I also learned about the Teaching Garden, a wonderful half-acre of land. Vegetables are grown organically (with nothing but compost and whole lot of patience and volunteer hours!) that the food bank then distributes to partner agencies.</p>
    <p> After volunteering at the teaching garden a few times, I realized how incredible they were. Not only do they provide volunteer oppportunities and educational opportunities, but they were also producing fresh food! Many area schools also have smaller teaching gardens where students are able to learn about nutrition, biology, responsibility, observation, and community service while growing something leafy for their school cafeteria.</p>
    <p> I hope you'll embrace this cause as much as I have and either go out and volunteer at one of these gardens or start your own!</p>
